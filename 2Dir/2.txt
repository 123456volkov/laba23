Adventure travel
Time for an adventure?

Are you a bit bored with your nine-to-five routine? Have a look at our exciting range of holidays and decide what type of adventure you’d like.

Activity holidays
Our activity holidays are for everyone, people who love danger or who just like sports. We have a huge variety of water, snow or desert holidays. We’ll take you SCUBA diving in the Red Sea or kayaking and white water rafting in Canada. If you prefer snow, you can try skiing or snowboarding in the Alps or even igloo-building. For those who like warmer weather, we also have sandboarding (the desert version of skateboarding) or camel safaris.

Polar expeditions
Take a cruise to Antarctica or the northern Arctic; explore a land of white natural beauty and wonderful wildlife. Our experts will explain everything about the two poles as you watch the penguins in Antarctica or whales and polar bears in the Arctic. There's no greater adventure than travelling to the ends of the earth. A once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Cultural journeys
Our cultural journeys will help you discover ancient civilisations: India, Thailand, Egypt and many more. Visit temples, palaces and ancient ruins – just remember to bring your camera! Get to know local ways of life by exploring markets, trying exotic foods and meeting local people.

Trekking tours
We have trekking holidays to famous places such as Machu Picchu or the Everest Base Camp Trek, as well as some nearer to home in the Highlands of Scotland. You don’t need to be very sporty, just fairly fit. You’ll have a great time enjoying nature with a group of new friends. Some of the holidays include camping, but we’ll transport the tents for you!

Wildlife holidays
We organise small-group tours to get closer to nature in Africa, Asia or South America. Go on safari in Africa and watch lions and giraffes. Meet the famous turtles of the Galapagos Islands. Look for tigers in India, or take an elephant safari in Sri Lanka. We use local guides and stay in a range of accommodation, from tents to tree houses.

My best holiday was coming to a highland. It was so cool. I could see the pine, the large mountains, and the old houses. I also had a warm drink when came to the highest point of the highland. Everything was great. I wish I can come back here in another day.

Hi felixminecraft,

This is a text in the style of a travel brochure for you to practise your reading. 

Before you read you can do the preparation exercise to help you with vocabulary for adventure travel. When you have finished reading you can do the other exercises to check if you've understood the text correctly.

I hope that helps.

 

Best wishes,

Jo (LearnEnglish Teens team)

The text explains the various holidays proposed by talking about the services offered by the agency, holidays and what can be done in these places. My best holidays have been in Spain. We went to the beach, to the pool and we did some climbing.

Last week,I went to Thailand with my family and friends. We stayed 4nights there. I went Dream World,Night market,Floating Markets,Hua Hin Beach and Temples. Even we went as much as we can,there’s a lot of places to go. I had to comeback home even I still want to travel more.Because my parents’ work ,I had to came back.Among many places I have gone,floating market is my favorite place.I don’t know why I love that place so much.But my heart was left there.The next place I love is Night market.It’s just a paradise for me.There’s a lot to eat and everything seems yummy.Having local foods and giving a chat with a local is the best way of traveling for me. I had tried many Thai foods there.But many places are left to go .There are not only Morten places but also historical places in Thailand.Everybody will love that country what kind of adventures you like. When I was older,I will go back again.

My favourite journey was to Malaysia which was profoundly intriguing because it was when I was 8 or 9 years old and that was the first time I recollect visiting a peregrine country. I visited the most pulchritudinous places I could optically discern like the butterfly garden which was a house full of butterflies.And there withal was a this most immensely colossal bird park in the world located somewhere in Kuala Lumpur.And the skyscrapers such as The Petronas Towers, additionally kenned as the Petronas Twin Towers, are twin skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The best holiday i've ever had was in Davao. I rode the Sky Swing - hanging from our harness 95 feet off the ground, the Sky Cycle - riding a bike on a cable which is 60 feet high, and gliding along the Sky Rider - a 200 meter long steel cable suspended roughly 20 meters in the air between two steel towers. It took a lot of courage for me to do those activities and defy my fear of heights.

My best holiday was in Saudi Arabia, Makkah and Madina. These two cities are considered holy in the light of Islam and many muslims go to these places for pilgrimage. What I found exciting was not only the fact of visiting such holy places, it was also because of the beautiful sceneries of these fascinating cities. Ancient artifacts in old museums and many beautiful sceneries. Going there was really a wonderful experience.

Hi ..
I used to travel a lot with my extended family, with my parents, my cousins, aunts and uncles, and ofcourse my grandma. We were quite a large group of people, and though i used to find travelling with these many people exhausting and restrictive in some ways, I must say I dearly miss those many trips and journeys and travels we undertook.
I hope I will be able to travel after I graduate high school, you know during my gap year and all. Bye

Hi! I have two amazing holidays - summer trips to Skiathos and Corfu, Greek islands. Beaches are some of the most beautiful in the world and people are very friendly and nice. There is something for everyone so you can be sure you'll find some way to have fun. I have tried a lot of different food like sqiuds and octopus.

My Best holidays i've ever had was two years ago. I went to spain to canaries island. I went There for two weeks. The view from the hotel room was beautiful. The best think in this hotel were swimming pools. I love swimming. That's my second favorite sport. The food was very strange for me because I'm from Poland, but they were delicious. I love Spain.

Hi guys, my best holiday was when i went to a beach in Chile. Is in a place called Maitencillo, and the sand of the beach is very soft and the water is lightblue.
I went when I was 3 years old and my sister was 1 year old.
A funny thing that happened was that my little sister found the sand so soft that she ate it.

Hi, I don't think animals are 'cheap'. They might not be able to read and write, but they are living organisms who can do a lot many things which humans are incapable of. Actually if asked them, they might say humans can't be compared to animals.

Hi, please read our House Rules and make sure you don't include personal details when you write comments here next time. Thanks.

'Hate' seems too strong. You could say you 'dislike' animals or 'I have no interest in animals'.
